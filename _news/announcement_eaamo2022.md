Our paper ["Fair Decision-Making for Food Inspections"](assets/pdf/fairfood_eaamo_2022.pdf) got accepted at the second ACM conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization ([EAAMO'22](https://eaamo.org/)) as an oral presentation. It was a delight interacting with the diverse community members with shared interest in fairness, algorithmic decision-making and operations research.
