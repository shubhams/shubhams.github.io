I am a Ph.D. student with the Department of Computer Science at the [University
of Illinois at Chicago](https://cs.uic.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I'm advised by
[Chris Kanich](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/){:target="\_blank"}, and my
research focuses on the areas of Security and Privacy, Algorithmic Fairness, and
Computational Social Science. 

In the past, I have worked at [Precog Research
Lab](http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/){:target="\_blank"}, where I was advised by
[Ponnurangam Kumaraguru "PK"](https://twitter.com/ponguru). My industrial
experience includes working as a Full Stack Developer at an Amazon Pay-acquired
startup and a software developer intern at
[MobiKwik](https://www.mobikwik.com/){:target="\_blank"}. I received my
undergraduate degree from
[IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} in Computer Science.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
