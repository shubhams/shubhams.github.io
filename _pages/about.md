I am a Ph.D. student with the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://cs.uic.edu/), where I'm advised by [Chris Kanich](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/) and [Ian A. Kash](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~iankash/), and my research focuses on the areas of Algorithmic Fairness, Security and Privacy, and Computational Social Science.

In the past, I worked at [Precog Research Lab](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) as a Research Associate, where I was advised by [Ponnurangam Kumaraguru "PK"](https://twitter.com/ponguru) and [Arun Balaji Buduru](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~arunb/). My industrial experience includes working as a Full Stack Developer at an [Amazon Pay-acquired startup](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tapzo/) and a software developer intern at [MobiKwik](https://www.mobikwik.com/). I received my undergraduate degree from [IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) in Computer Science.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
